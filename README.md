# Webdesign Seminar Project

This project is a final assignment for subject **PV219** *Webdesign seminar*.
The subject was taught in spring semester 2016 at *Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno*.

**Task:**
My task was to develop previously designed web page (see The Page.png in this folder) using 3 CSS frameworks.

**Bootstrap:**
The first framework I have chosen was Bootstrap 3.
It was very hard for me to get started as I did not have practically any experience with wed development except some theoretical basics. However when the project was set up and I refreshed some knowledge of CSS, it became quite smooth to use Bootstrap. I did not want to use templates, however it was extremely hard for me to begin from scratch so I decided to work with the template Cover that is available in Bootstrap example files. Since than, even if I got stuck number of times the development became rather easy. Still I needed to try a lot before I came to the result I wanted, but at least I knew what was I doing and I knew how to solve problems.
I think, now I can proudly call myself "Bootstrap beginner" :)

**What I used:**
* Atom - as a text editor
* GitKraken - as git GUI client
* GitHub - as git server
* Dash - for offline documentation
* Chrome - as browser
