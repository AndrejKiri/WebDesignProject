# Webdesign Seminar Project

This project was a final assignment for subject **PV219** *Webdesign seminar* that I took in spring semester 2016 during my university studies at *Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno*.

**Task:**
My task was to develop a previously designed web page (see The Page.png in this folder) using a selected CSS framework.

**Bootstrap:**
I chose the Bootstrap 3 framework. It was very hard for me to get started as I did not have practically any experience with web development back then except for some theory. However, when the project was set up and I refreshed some knowledge of CSS, it became quite smooth to use Bootstrap. I think, now I can proudly call myself "Bootstrap beginner" :)

**What I used:**
* Atom - as a text editor
* GitKraken - as git GUI client
* GitHub - as a git server
* Dash - for offline documentation
* Chrome - as browser
